# Elastic Beanstalk

> allows you to deploy web application and web services to AWS

- orchestration service that provisions resources
- automatically handles the deployment
- monitors application health via a health dashboard
- developer centric view of deploying an application on AWS
- automatically handles:
	- capacity adjustment
	- load balancing
	- automatic scaling
	- application health monitoring
	- instance configuration

- ðŸ‘€ FREE ðŸ‘‰ you pay for underlying resources used

## Components

1. Application ðŸ‘‰ collection of Elastic Beanstalk components (environment versions / configurations)
2. Application Version ðŸ‘‰ interation of your application code
3. Collection of AWS resource running an application version (only one application version at a time)
	- Tiers
		- Web Server Environment Tier
			- typical 3 tier environment
				- ELB ðŸ‘‰ Auto Scaling Group ðŸ‘‰ multiple instances in different availability zones
		- Worker Environment Tier
			- based on SQS Queue ðŸ‘‰ instances are the "workers" and they pull out of the available queue
			- scaled based on the number of SQS messages
			- can push messages to SQS queue from another Web Server Tier
		- supports multiple environments (_dev / test / prod_)

## Deployment Modes

1. Single Instance (development_)
2. High Availability w/ Load Balancer (_prod_)

## Deployment Options

- All at once
	- fastest deployment
	- application has downtime
	- great for quick iterations in development environment
	- no additional cost ðŸ‘‰ same underlying infrastructure

	```
	V1 ðŸ‘‰ down ðŸ‘‰ V2
	V1 ðŸ‘‰ down ðŸ‘‰ V2
	V1 ðŸ‘‰ down ðŸ‘‰ V2
	V1 ðŸ‘‰ down ðŸ‘‰ V2
	```
- Rolling
	- run below capacity
	- segmented transition across instances ðŸ‘‰ you will be running both simultaniously for a short period of tim
	- no additional cost ðŸ‘‰ same underlying infrastructure
	- ðŸ”† use for dev
	```
	V1 ðŸ‘‰ down ðŸ‘‰ V2 ðŸ‘‰ V2
	V1 ðŸ‘‰ down ðŸ‘‰ V2 ðŸ‘‰ V2
	V1 ðŸ‘‰ V1 ðŸ‘‰ down ðŸ‘‰ V2
	V1 ðŸ‘‰ V1 ðŸ‘‰ down ðŸ‘‰ V2
	```
- Rolling w/ additional batches
	- run at capacity
	- pay for new instances while they are being used
	- ðŸ”† use for prod
	```
	RUNNING 	V1 ðŸ‘‰ down 	ðŸ‘‰ V2 		ðŸ‘‰ V2
	RUNNING 	V1 ðŸ‘‰ down 	ðŸ‘‰ V2 		ðŸ‘‰ V2
	RUNNING 	V1 ðŸ‘‰ V1 	ðŸ‘‰ down 	ðŸ‘‰ V2
	RUNNING 	V1 ðŸ‘‰ V1	ðŸ‘‰ down 	ðŸ‘‰ V2

	NEW 		V2 ðŸ‘‰ V2	ðŸ‘‰ V2		ðŸ‘‰ terminated
	NEW 		V2 ðŸ‘‰ V2	ðŸ‘‰ V2		ðŸ‘‰ terminated
	```
- Immutabble
	- zero downtime
	- Steps
		1. create `Temp ASG` w/ V2
		2. Move `Temp ASG` into `Current ASG` ðŸ‘‰ `Current ASG now hae double the instances`
		3. Remove V1 instances from `Current ASG`
	- ðŸ”† best for prod


## Blue Green

- note really a "feature" of Elastic Beanstalk but it can be made to do so

## Traffic Splitting

> Canary Testing

- no down time
- pay for new instances while they are in used
- steps:
	- new application version is deployed to temporary ASG with the same capacity
	- small % of traffic is sent to temporary ASG for a configurable amount of time
	- deployment health is monitored
		- if deployment failure ðŸ‘‰ triggers auto rollback (very quick)
		- traffic stops going to failed temporary version

## Cloning

> clone an existing environment with the exact same configuration ðŸ‘‰ used for deploying a "test" version of your application

- all resources and configuration are presetved
	- load balancer type and configuration
	- RDS data base type (but the data is not presetved)
	- Env Variables
