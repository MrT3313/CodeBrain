# Scalability

- `Scalability` ðŸ‘‰ beginning w/ only the resources you need and designing the architecture fo automatically respond to changing demand
	- `Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling`
		- Types:
			1. `Dynamic Scaling` ðŸ‘‰ responds to changing demand
			2. `Predictive Scaling` ðŸ‘‰ schedules the right number of EC2 instances based on predicted demand
		- Coniguration
			- `minimum capacity` ðŸ‘‰ # of instances that launch immediately after creating Auto Scaling Group
			- `desired capacity` ðŸ‘‰
			- `maximum capacity` ðŸ‘‰ 


    - Vertical (_scale up_):
        - give a single instance more memory / CPU
    
    - Horizontal (_scale out_):
        - create move instances

- `Elasticity` ðŸ‘‰
