# Application Load Balancer (ALB - V2)

> great for micro services & container-based applications

- layer 7 only load balancer (HTTP)
- route to multiple HTTP application across machines (target group)
- load balancing multiple applications on the same machine (Containers / ecs)
- supports HTTPS/2 and WebSocket
- redirects (from HTTP to HTTPS)
- Root Routing ðŸ‘‰ routing tables to different target groups
	- `PATH` based routing
	- `hostname` based routing
	- `QueryString / Headers`
- Port Mapping
	- redirect to dynamic port in ECS

## Target Groups
	- `EC2 INSTANCES` (can be managed by Auto Scaling Group) - HTTP
	- `ECS TASKS` - HTTP
	- `Lambda Functions` - HTTP request is translated into a JSON event

## Sticky Sessions (Session Affinity)

> implement stickiness so that the same client is always redirected to the same instance behind a load balancer
> ðŸš¨ also works w/ the Classic Load Balancer but that should not be used anymore as it is a previous generation of ELB
