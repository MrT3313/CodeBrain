# Code Build (_managed_)

> used for building and testing the application source code

- compiles source code and runs tests
- enables continuous integration and delivery
- produced build artifacts ready to be deployed
- build instructions are defined in in code ðŸ‘‰ `buildspec.yml` || docker image
	- can use S3 as a 'cache' as you move through your build
- output logs to S3 & CloudWatch
- uses Docker under the hood ðŸ‘‰ can leverage your own Docker images
- only pay for usage
	- unlike Jenkins when your paying for the server

## buildspec.yml

- plaintext variables
- secure secrets ðŸ‘‰ use SSM Parameter store
- phases
	1. Install ðŸ‘‰ dependencies you may need for your build
	2. PreBuild ðŸ‘‰ final commands to execute before build
	3. Build ðŸ‘‰ actual build commands
	4. PostBuild ðŸ‘‰ finishing touches

- can be run locally (after installing Docker)
	- will give you access to better logging
	- use CodeBuild Agent

## in VPC

> CodeBuild containers are launched outside of your VPC ðŸ‘‰ therefore by default it cannot access resources in a VPC

- specify
	- VPC ID
	- Subnet ID
	- Security Group ID
- use case:
	- integration tests / data query / internal load balancers
